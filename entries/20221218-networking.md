### How Leaders Create and Use Networks

* Networking is an unofficial professional requirement
* Creating personal connection, on any level, outside of formal organizational structure, is worthwhile

#### Types of Networking
* Operational: effective performance of formal responsibilities
* Personal: shared goals outside of organization structure
* Strategic: networking within larger org structure but outside of immediate reporting tree

Reference: HBR R0701C

### A Smarter Way To Network
Effective networks contain six types:
* information, ideas, expertise
* formally, informal power, mentorship
* developmental feedback, personal support
* personal worthiness
* work life balance
* energizers

How to improve:
1. identify who your connections are and what they offer
1. retract redundant, energy draining connections
1. fill holes in network
1. reinvest in existing contacts
